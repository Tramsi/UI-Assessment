# ui-Assessment

Implementing responsive design with fixing the ui and ux issues in design and addressing the changes in comments in the stylesheets.

note: searching by the keyword "changed" in the stylesheets will result to the comments about changes made.

## Changes made to the design

**General:**
  - All gaps between cards are the same.
  - All cards rounded corners are the same.
  - All cards have the same padding.
  - All buttons have the same styling and text within them centered.
  
**Statistics card:**
  - Lowerd content text font-size (It needs to be discussed with the designer to know if it's intended to be bigger) 
  - Changed pending status color to yellowish color to represent the status .
  
**Transaction card:**
  - Changed number color and font in transaction card to be consistent with the rest of design.
  
**Slider card:**
  - Changed text and slider dotgroup colors to match the design primary and secondary colors
  - Changed dots position to the center to be more clear for user that the whole card is a slider (It needs to be discussed with the designer if the whole card is a slider or just the text part of it ?! if it's the second choice it would be better to be centered to the text half of card)
